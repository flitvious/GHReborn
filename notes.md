## Things to consider

* libtcode zip should be integraed properly (subfolders at least), cheap stuff for now

## Some sort of roadmap

These are the features I want first:

* Fightable mecha (one simple arena level)
	* Weapons, damage types, armor
	* Mecha design files + constructor(?)
	* Mecha components
	* Mecha salvage from other mecha

This stuff comes after the combat:
* Random Maps
* Wilderness
* Plots
