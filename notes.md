## Things to consider

* libtcode zip should be integraed properly, cheap stuff for now
* wrapper around libtcod random numbers function
* wrappers around all libcode stuff to eventually replace libtcode (no mac support = bad)


## Some sort of roadmap

These are the features I want first:

* Fightable mecha (one simple arena level)
	* Weapons, damage types, armor
	* Mecha design files + constructor(?)
	* Mecha components
	* Mecha salvage from other mecha

This stuff comes after the combat:
* Random Maps
* Wilderness
* Plots
